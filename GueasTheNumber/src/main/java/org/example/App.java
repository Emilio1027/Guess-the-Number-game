     * You are going to make a "Guess the Number game".The computer will "think" of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask
     * the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the user whether the number is too
     * high or too low.
     * The user wins if they can guess the number within six tries The program should look like this in the console:
     * Hello! What is your name?
     * Well, Emilio, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20
     * Take a guess.
     * 10
     * Your guess is too high.
     * Take a guess.
     * 2
     * Your guess is too low
     * Take a guess.
     * 4
     * Good job, Emilio! You guessed my number 3 guesses!
     * would you like to play again? (y or n)
     * n
     * Process finished with exit code 0
